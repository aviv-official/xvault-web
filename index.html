								<p>We believe that freedom of speech is a fundamental human right and money just another way we communicate.</p>  
								
								<p>Communicating with friends should be easy, fast and simple.  Sending money to help pay a bill, or just buying a cup of coffee together should not be a hassle.</p>
								<p>To that end, we have created an easy to use peer to peer electronic cash platform that is socially oriented, cryptographically secure, instantaneous and completely uncensorable.</p>
								
								<p>Welcome to XVault! The culmination of decades of research and planning into a sustainable, modern monetary system for the 21st Century and beyond.</p>

								<p>With XVault, you have the freedom to move into and out of any asset at your leisure, but they all spend the same.  Furthermore our own tokens are all stable, this means that if you go to bed with a dollar, it will still be worth a dollar in the morning.</p>
								<p>Soon we will be offering a debit card linked to your XVault account to allow you to spend your funds offline at the brick and mortar businesses you already shop at.  In the meantime, we provide a convenient electronic wallet you can use to pay bills and transfer funds.  It's like paypal or venmo, only better!</p>
								<p>We have a whitepaper that goes into great detail about the technical fundamentals and the economics that make this all work.  You can download and read about it here.</p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/checking.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>A Deposit, or "Current" account is the default account type when you open an account inside XVault.</p>
								<p>This is also known as demand draft or checking account, depending on your locale.  The purpose of this class of account is to give you immediate access to your funds.  XVault current accounts can pay a nominal interest depending on current network conditions, but in general this class of account should be considered your immediate funds, or spending money.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Money Market Accounts</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/money-market.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Money Market accounts are high yield savings accounts within XVault</p>
								<p>Within XVault you can open a money market account and set your desired daily interest rate.  Upon doing so, funds are moved from your deposit account to your money market account and you lose availability for a minimum of 48 hours.</p>
								<p>Funds in the money market are lent to margin traders who borrow the funds and use them to open leveraged margin positions.  You are paid the interest you requested when this happens.</p>
								<p>The interest you actually collect is a direct function of the money & margins market, it is possible that you may set your prefered interest rate too high and there are no takers.  However for the most part, if you set a daily interest of 1% you can expect annualized returns of 36%, although this is not guaranteed.</p>
								<p>Funds in the market are insured by XVault and this is enforced by blockchain backed smart contracts specific to the XVault ecosystem.  This means there is no way to lose your money when you place it in the money market account.  Therefore you can treat this like a savings account.</p>
								<p>When you receive your interest payment, it will be sent to your deposit account, but you can send it back to the money market automatically in order to compound your gains.</p>

								<p>We know how stressful it can be to deal with currencies you aren't accustomed to.  So we made it dirt simple.</p>
								<p>Exchanging between assets whether they be national currencies or crypto currencies is simple fast and easy.  It doesn't require any special effort or skill on your part and it can be done from within any deposit account, to any deposit account.</p>
								<p>This function is built into your XVault wallet and is completely free other than the nominal transfer fee.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Margin Accounts</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/margin.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>A margin account allows you to profit enormously on even small changes in an asset price.</p>
								<p>Unlike our other account types.  This type of account carries a risk with it such that you could lose your entire principal if the market moves against your position and you have not set appropriate limits.  As a result, this account type is not suited for everyone.  However if you have the apetite for risk, the rewards can be enormous.</p>
								<p>XVault allows you to leverage up to 100x meaning a change as small as 1% can double the amount of money you have.</p>
								<p>For instance if you do a margin trade with a position of $1000 USD and the price of the asset you are trading moves just 1% you could walk away with $2000 USD, all while only putting $100 USD at risk.</p>
								<p>These are obviously, phenominal returns and as such they do not represent the norm, but they do happen, especially when you take into account volatile cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum which frequently move 1 or 2 percent daily.</p>
								<p>Again, this type of trading isn't for everyone, but if you are the type who is itching for the highest possible risk with the highest possible return rate, this is probably the account you are looking for.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Retirement Accounts</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/retirement.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Saving for retirement is hard, and saving for an early retirement is even harder but it doesn't have to be that way!</p>
								<p>Every XVault account has a built in retirement account.</p>
								<p>Imagine what it would be like if every time you swiped your bank card, the bank contributed something to your retirement fund?</p>
								<p>What if all the things you post to social media, earned you a few pennies in your retirement account per like or upvote?</p>
								<p>Imagine if your bank also contributed money to your retirement fund each time someone you know opened a new account?</p>
								<p>What if on top of all of that, the bank decided to take the fees it collects throughout the day and divvy it up into each customer's retirement account?</p>
								
								<p>That's what we've done!<br>Our technology is built on top of distributed, peer to peer networks, we utilize blockchains and smart contracts to do the heavily lifting transparently and securely.  That's a fancy way of saying our costs are minimal.  So we find ways to give that back to you.</p>
								<p>There's a lot of banks with "cash back rewards" credit cards.  Our system puts that cash back reward and a whole lot of other rewards into a fund intended for your retirement.</p>
								<p>The best part is, you can choose to retire at anytime once you reach the minimum balance in your retirement account.</p>
								<p>As soon as you decide it's time to retire or even to take an extended vacation, you no longer collect rewards, but you do receive a daily payment.</p>
								<p>The value of this daily payment is about $240 USD per day, and it is tied to an inflationary matrix, meaning that if the cost of living goes up so does your daily payment.</p>
								<p>Here is how this works.  Every time you use the system, you earn retirement credit called VIP.  Each VIP you have is worth 1 retirement credit.  As soon as you have enough retirement credits saved up for at least 10 years worth of drawdowns, you can flip the switch and start collecting that money every single day.  If you decide later on to leave retirement mode and begin collecting rewards again, it is a simple matter of flipping that switch to the off position.</p>
								<p>At the moment each VIP has a value of about $10 but this value is subject to change based on inflation, but you don't need to worry about that.  You just focus on saving up enough VIP credits and the world is your oyster.</p>
								<p>It's easy to do!  There are both active and passive mechanisms tied to account activity, and you can also purchase VIP directly in order to speed up the compounding process.</p>
								<p>When you decide the time is right to ride off into the sunset, turn on retirement mode and enjoy your reward, you've earned it!</p>

								<p>Our rewards system is epic!<br>Of course you earn rewards for every transaction.  But our system also rewards you for the things you are already doing anyways, such as blogging about your life on social media.  How cool is that?</p>
								<p>Yes that's right.  When you post updates on select social media sites, you earn rewards.  Also you can give rewards to your family, friends and acquaintances, just by liking, upvoting and commenting!  It's the stuff you're already doing, so why not enjoy some rewards?</p>
